jheartsj-repl
=============

A very simple REPL for interacting with the jheartsj Java library. (You
don't have this library.)

Installation
------------

Build and install the `ch.glts.jheartsj:jheartsj` dependency by running

    mvn install

in that project.

Usage
-----

Use `lein run` to start the REPL and type some jheartsj J.

Play with it until it crashes, which is probably soon.
